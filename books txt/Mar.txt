Mar 1:1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Mar 1:2 As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare
your way,
Mar 1:3 the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
Mar 1:4 John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness
of sins.
Mar 1:5 And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in
the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
Mar 1:6 Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and
wild honey.
Mar 1:7 And he preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am
not worthy to stoop down and untie.
Mar 1:8 I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
Mar 1:9 In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
Mar 1:10 And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens opening and the Spirit
descending on him like a dove.
Mar 1:11 And a voice came from heaven, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."
Mar 1:12 The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.
Mar 1:13 And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals,and the angels were ministering to him.
Mar 1:14 Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God,
Mar 1:15 and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."
Mar 1:16 Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net
into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Mar 1:17 And Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men."
Mar 1:18 And immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Mar 1:19 And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their
boat mending the nets.
Mar 1:20 And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants
and followed him.
Mar 1:21 And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was
teaching.
Mar 1:22 And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the
scribes.
Mar 1:23 And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,
Mar 1:24 "What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you arethe Holy One of God."
Mar 1:25 But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!"
Mar 1:26 And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him.
Mar 1:27 And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new
teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."
Mar 1:28 And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.
Mar 1:29 And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and
John.
Mar 1:30 Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.
Mar 1:31 And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to
serve them.
Mar 1:32 That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons.
Mar 1:33 And the whole city was gathered together at the door.
Mar 1:34 And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would
not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.
Mar 1:35 And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate
place, and there he prayed.
Mar 1:36 And Simon and those who were with him searched for him,
Mar 1:37 and they found him and said to him, "Everyone is looking for you."
Mar 1:38 And he said to them, "Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I
came out."
Mar 1:39 And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.
Mar 1:40 And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, "If you will, you can make me
clean."
Mar 1:41 Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, "I will; be clean."
Mar 1:42 And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.
Mar 1:43 And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once,
Mar 1:44 and said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for
your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them."
Mar 1:45 But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no
longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter.
Mar 2:1 And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home.
Mar 2:2 And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was
preaching the word to them.
Mar 2:3 And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men.
Mar 2:4 And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and
when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay.
Mar 2:5 And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "My son, your sins are forgiven."
Mar 2:6 Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts,
Mar 2:7 "Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
Mar 2:8 And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to
them, "Why do you question these things in your hearts?Mar 2:9 Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise, take up your bed and
walk'?
Mar 2:10 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"- he said to the
paralyticMar 2:11 "I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home."
Mar 2:12 And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all
amazed and glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!"
Mar 2:13 He went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them.
Mar 2:14 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him,
"Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
Mar 2:15 And as he reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and
his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
Mar 2:16 And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors,
said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Mar 2:17 And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those
who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."
Mar 2:18 Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to him, "Why do
John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Mar 2:19 And Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as
they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
Mar 2:20 The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.
Mar 2:21 No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch tears away from it, the
new from the old, and a worse tear is made.
Mar 2:22 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins- and the wine is
destroyed, and so are the skins. But new wine is for fresh wineskins."
Mar 2:23 One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields, and as they made their way, his disciples began to
pluck heads of grain.
Mar 2:24 And the Pharisees were saying to him, "Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
Mar 2:25 And he said to them, "Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he
and those who were with him:
Mar 2:26 how he entered the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the bread of the
Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?"
Mar 2:27 And he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
Mar 2:28 So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."
Mar 3:1 Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand.
Mar 3:2 And they watched Jesus, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse
him.
Mar 3:3 And he said to the man with the withered hand, "Come here."
Mar 3:4 And he said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?" But
they were silent.
Mar 3:5 And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man,
"Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
Mar 3:6 The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy
him.
Mar 3:7 Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea
Mar 3:8 and Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon. When the
great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him.
Mar 3:9 And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they crush him,
Mar 3:10 for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed around him to touch him.
Mar 3:11 And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son
of God."
Mar 3:12 And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.
Mar 3:13 And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him.
Mar 3:14 And he appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and he might
send them out to preach
Mar 3:15 and have authority to cast out demons.
Mar 3:16 He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);
Mar 3:17 James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges,
that is, Sons of Thunder);Mar 3:18 Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus,
and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,
Mar 3:19 and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
Mar 3:20 Then he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat.
Mar 3:21 And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, "He is out of his mind."
Mar 3:22 And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, "He is possessed by Beelzebul," and
"by the prince of demons he casts out the demons."
Mar 3:23 And he called them to him and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?
Mar 3:24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
Mar 3:25 And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
Mar 3:26 And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.
Mar 3:27 But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong
man. Then indeed he may plunder his house.
Mar 3:28 "Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter,
Mar 3:29 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"-
Mar 3:30 for they had said, "He has an unclean spirit."
Mar 3:31 And his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him.
Mar 3:32 And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, "Your mother and your brothers are outside,
seeking you."
Mar 3:33 And he an swered them, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"
Mar 3:34 And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!
Mar 3:35 Whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother."
Mar 4:1 Again he began to teach beside the sea. And a very large crowd gathered about him, so that he got into
a boat and sat in it on the sea, and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land.
Mar 4:2 And he was teaching them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them:
Mar 4:3 "Listen! A sower went out to sow.
Mar 4:4 And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.
Mar 4:5 Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it
had no depth of soil.
Mar 4:6 And when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root, it withered away.
Mar 4:7 Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.
Mar 4:8 And other seeds fell into good soil and produced grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold
and sixtyfold and a hundredfold."
Mar 4:9 And he said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
Mar 4:10 And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.
Mar 4:11 And he said to them, "To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside
everything is in parables,
Mar 4:12 so that "they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand, lest they
should turn and be forgiven."
Mar 4:13 And he said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the
parables?
Mar 4:14 The sower sows the word.
Mar 4:15 And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately
comes and takes away the word that is sown in them.
Mar 4:16 And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately
receive it with joy.
Mar 4:17 And they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while. Then, when tribulation or persecution
arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.
Mar 4:18 And others are the ones sown among thorns. They are those who hear the word,
Mar 4:19 but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and
choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.
Mar 4:20 But those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit,
thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold."
Mar 4:21 And he said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket, or under a bed, and not on a
stand?
Mar 4:22 For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret except to come to light.
Mar 4:23 If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."
Mar 4:24 And he said to them, "Pay attention to what you hear: with the measure you use, it will be measured to
you, and still more will be added to you.Mar 4:25 For to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he has will be
taken away."
Mar 4:26 And he said, "The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground.
Mar 4:27 He sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows; he knows not how.
Mar 4:28 The earth produces by itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
Mar 4:29 But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come."
Mar 4:30 And he said, "With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it?
Mar 4:31 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on
earth,
Mar 4:32 yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large
branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade."
Mar 4:33 With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.
Mar 4:34 He did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.
Mar 4:35 On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side."
Mar 4:36 And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. And other boats were with
him.
Mar 4:37 And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already
filling.
Mar 4:38 But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you
not care that we are perishing?"
Mar 4:39 And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, and
there was a great calm.
Mar 4:40 He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?"
Mar 4:41 And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even wind and sea
obey him?"
Mar 5:1 They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes.
Mar 5:2 And when Jesus had stepped out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with
an unclean spirit.
Mar 5:3 He lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain,
Mar 5:4 for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart, and he broke
the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him.
Mar 5:5 Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and bruising himself
with stones.
Mar 5:6 And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him.
Mar 5:7 And crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High
God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me."
Mar 5:8 For he was saying to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"
Mar 5:9 And Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He replied, "My name is Legion, for we are many."
Mar 5:10 And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country.
Mar 5:11 Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside,
Mar 5:12 and they begged him, saying, "Send us to the pigs; let us enter them."
Mar 5:13 So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the pigs, and the herd,
numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned in the sea.
Mar 5:14 The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that
had happened.
Mar 5:15 And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man, the one who had had the legion, sitting
there, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.
Mar 5:16 And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and
to the pigs.
Mar 5:17 And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their region.
Mar 5:18 As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he
might be with him.
Mar 5:19 And he did not permit him but said to him, "Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord
has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."
Mar 5:20 And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and
everyone marveled.
Mar 5:21 And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him,
and he was beside the sea.
Mar 5:22 Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, he fell at his feetMar 5:23 and implored him earnestly, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your
hands on her, so that she may be made well and live."
Mar 5:24 And he went with him. And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him.
Mar 5:25 And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years,
Mar 5:26 and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better
but rather grew worse.
Mar 5:27 She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his
garment.
Mar 5:28 For she said, "If I touch even his garments, I will be made well."
Mar 5:29 And immediately the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her
disease.
Mar 5:30 And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, immediately turned about in the
crowd and said, "Who touched my garments?"
Mar 5:31 And his disciples said to him, "You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, 'Who touched
me?'"
Mar 5:32 And he looked around to see who had done it.
Mar 5:33 But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before
him and told him the whole truth.
Mar 5:34 And he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your
disease."
Mar 5:35 While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler's house some who said, "Your daughter is
dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?"
Mar 5:36 But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, "Do not fear, only believe."
Mar 5:37 And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.
Mar 5:38 They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and Jesus saw a commotion, people weeping
and wailing loudly.
Mar 5:39 And when he had entered, he said to them, "Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The
child is not dead but sleeping."
Mar 5:40 And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside and took the child's father and mother and those
who were with him and went in where the child was.
Mar 5:41 Taking her by the hand he said to her, "Talitha cumi," which means, "Little girl, I say to you, arise."
Mar 5:42 And immediately the girl got up and began walking (for she was twelve years of age), and they were
immediately overcome with amazement.
Mar 5:43 And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.
Mar 6:1 He went away from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.
Mar 6:2 And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished,
saying, "Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works
done by his hands?
Mar 6:3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And
are not his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him.
Mar 6:4 And Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his
relatives and in his own household."
Mar 6:5 And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed
them.
Mar 6:6 And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went about among the villages teaching.
Mar 6:7 And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the
unclean spirits.
Mar 6:8 He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff- no bread, no bag, no money in their
beltsMar 6:9 but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics.
Mar 6:10 And he said to them, "Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there.
Mar 6:11 And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust
that is on your feet as a testimony against them."
Mar 6:12 So they went out and proclaimed that people should repent.
Mar 6:13 And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.
Mar 6:14 King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, "John the Baptist has been
raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him."
Mar 6:15 But others said, "He is Elijah." And others said, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old."
Mar 6:16 But when Herod heard of it, he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised."Mar 6:17 For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his
brother Philip's wife, because he had married her.
Mar 6:18 For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
Mar 6:19 And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not,
Mar 6:20 for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he
heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.
Mar 6:21 But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military
commanders and the leading men of Galilee.
Mar 6:22 For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king
said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you."
Mar 6:23 And he vowed to her, "Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."
Mar 6:24 And she went out and said to her mother, "For what should I ask?" And she said, "The head of John
the Baptist."
Mar 6:25 And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, "I want you to give me at once
the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
Mar 6:26 And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break
his word to her.
Mar 6:27 And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. He went and
beheaded him in the prison
Mar 6:28 and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
Mar 6:29 When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
Mar 6:30 , The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught.
Mar 6:31 And he said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while." For many were
coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.
Mar 6:32 And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves.
Mar 6:33 Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got
there ahead of them.
Mar 6:34 When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like
sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things.
Mar 6:35 And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, "This is a desolate place, and the hour is
now late.
Mar 6:36 Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to
eat."
Mar 6:37 But he answered them, "You give them something to eat." And they said to him, "Shall we go and buy
two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?"
Mar 6:38 And he said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go and see." And when they had found out,
they said, "Five, and two fish."
Mar 6:39 Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.
Mar 6:40 So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.
Mar 6:41 And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the
loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all.
Mar 6:42 And they all ate and were satisfied.
Mar 6:43 And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.
Mar 6:44 And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.
Mar 6:45 Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida,
while he dismissed the crowd.
Mar 6:46 And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the mountain to pray.
Mar 6:47 And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land.
Mar 6:48 And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the
fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them,
Mar 6:49 but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out,
Mar 6:50 for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take heart; it is I.
Do not be afraid."
Mar 6:51 And he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded,
Mar 6:52 for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.
Mar 6:53 When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore.
Mar 6:54 And when they got out of the boat, the people immediately recognized him
Mar 6:55 and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to wherever they
heard he was.Mar 6:56 And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or countryside, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and
implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.
Mar 7:1 Now when the Pharisees gathered to him, with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem,
Mar 7:2 they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed.
Mar 7:3 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands, holding to the tradition of
the elders,
Mar 7:4 and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other
traditions that they observe, such as the washing of cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches.)
Mar 7:5 And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition
of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?"
Mar 7:6 And he said to them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, "' This people honors
me with their lips, but their heart is far from me;
Mar 7:7 in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'
Mar 7:8 You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men."
Mar 7:9 And he said to them, "You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish
your tradition!
Mar 7:10 For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must
surely die.'
Mar 7:11 But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother, Whatever you would have gained from me is
Corban' (that is, given to God)-
Mar 7:12 then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother,
Mar 7:13 thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And many such things
you do."
Mar 7:14 And he called the people to him again and said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand:
Mar 7:15 There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of
a person are what defile him."
Mar 7:16
Mar 7:17 And when he had entered the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable.
Mar 7:18 And he said to them, "Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes
into a person from outside cannot defile him,
Mar 7:19 since it enters not his heart but his stomach, and is expelled?" ( Thus he declared all foods clean.)
Mar 7:20 And he said, "What comes out of a person is what defiles him.
Mar 7:21 For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,
Mar 7:22 coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.
Mar 7:23 All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person."
Mar 7:24 And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house and
did not want anyone to know, yet he could not be hidden.
Mar 7:25 But immediately a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit heard of him and
came and fell down at his feet.
Mar 7:26 Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out
of her daughter.
Mar 7:27 And he said to her, "Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw
it to the dogs."
Mar 7:28 But she answered him, "Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."
Mar 7:29 And he said to her, "For this statement you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter."
Mar 7:30 And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone.
Mar 7:31 Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, in the region
of the Decapolis.
Mar 7:32 And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had a speech impediment, and they begged him to
lay his hand on him.
Mar 7:33 And taking him aside from the crowd privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting
touched his tongue.
Mar 7:34 And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, "Ephphatha," that is, "Be opened."
Mar 7:35 And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly.
Mar 7:36 And Jesus charged them to tell no one. But the more he charged them, the more zealously they
proclaimed it.
Mar 7:37 And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He even makes the
deaf hear and the mute speak."
Mar 8:1 In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, he called hisdisciples to him and said to them,
Mar 8:2 "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days and have nothing
to eat.
Mar 8:3 And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way. And some of them have come
from far away."
Mar 8:4 And his disciples answered him, "How can one feed these people with bread here in this desolate
place?"
Mar 8:5 And he asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven."
Mar 8:6 And he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and having given
thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the
crowd.
Mar 8:7 And they had a few small fish. And having blessed them, he said that these also should be set before
them.
Mar 8:8 And they ate and were satisfied. And they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full.
Mar 8:9 And there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away.
Mar 8:10 And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.
Mar 8:11 The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him.
Mar 8:12 And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you,
no sign will be given to this generation."
Mar 8:13 And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.
Mar 8:14 Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.
Mar 8:15 And he cautioned them, saying, "Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of
Herod."
Mar 8:16 And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread.
Mar 8:17 And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do
you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?
Mar 8:18 Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?
Mar 8:19 When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you
take up?" They said to him, "Twelve."
Mar 8:20 "And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?" And
they said to him, "Seven."
Mar 8:21 And he said to them, "Do you not yet understand?"
Mar 8:22 And they came to Bethsaida. And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch
him.
Mar 8:23 And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village, and when he had spit on his
eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, "Do you see anything?"
Mar 8:24 And he looked up and said, "I see men, but they look like trees, walking."
Mar 8:25 Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again; and he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he
saw everything clearly.
Mar 8:26 And he sent him to his home, saying, "Do not even enter the village."
Mar 8:27 And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his
disciples, "Who do people say that I am?"
Mar 8:28 And they told him, "John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets."
Mar 8:29 And he asked them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered him, "You are the Christ."
Mar 8:30 And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him.
Mar 8:31 And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the
elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again.
Mar 8:32 And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
Mar 8:33 But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, "Get behind me, Satan! For you are
not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Mar 8:34 And he called to him the crowd with his disciples and said to them, "If anyone would come after me, let
him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
Mar 8:35 For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will
save it.
Mar 8:36 For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?
Mar 8:37 For what can a man give in return for his life?
Mar 8:38 For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the
Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
Mar 9:1 And he said to them, "Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death untilthey see the kingdom of God after it has come with power."
Mar 9:2 And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain by
themselves. And he was transfigured before them,
Mar 9:3 and his clothes became radiant, intensely white, as no one on earth could bleach them.
Mar 9:4 And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
Mar 9:5 And Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and
one for Moses and one for Elijah."
Mar 9:6 For he did not know what to say, for they were terrified.
Mar 9:7 And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, "This is my beloved Son; listen to
him."
Mar 9:8 And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.
Mar 9:9 And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until
the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
Mar 9:10 So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead might mean.
Mar 9:11 And they asked him, "Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?"
Mar 9:12 And he said to them, "Elijah does come first to restore all things. And how is it written of the Son of
Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt?
Mar 9:13 But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him."
Mar 9:14 And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with
them.
Mar 9:15 And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly amazed and ran up to him and
greeted him.
Mar 9:16 And he asked them, "What are you arguing about with them?"
Mar 9:17 And someone from the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a spirit that
makes him mute.
Mar 9:18 And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid.
So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able."
Mar 9:19 And he answered them, "O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear
with you? Bring him to me."
Mar 9:20 And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and
he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.
Mar 9:21 And Jesus asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" And he said, "From
childhood.
Mar 9:22 And it has often cast him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have
compassion on us and help us."
Mar 9:23 And Jesus said to him, "If you can! All things are possible for one who believes."
Mar 9:24 Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, "I believe; help my unbelief!"
Mar 9:25 And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it,
"You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again."
Mar 9:26 And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse, so that
most of them said, "He is dead."
Mar 9:27 But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.
Mar 9:28 And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why could we not cast it out?"
Mar 9:29 And he said to them, "This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer."
Mar 9:30 They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know,
Mar 9:31 for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the
hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise."
Mar 9:32 But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.
Mar 9:33 And they came to Capernaum. And when he was in the house he asked them, "What were you
discussing on the way?"
Mar 9:34 But they kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest.
Mar 9:35 And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, "If anyone would be first, he must be last
of all and servant of all."
Mar 9:36 And he took a child and put him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them,
Mar 9:37 "Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not
me but him who sent me."
Mar 9:38 John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop
him, because he was not following us."
Mar 9:39 But Jesus said, "Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soonafterward to speak evil of me.
Mar 9:40 For the one who is not against us is for us.
Mar 9:41 For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will by
no means lose his reward.
Mar 9:42 "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great
millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.
Mar 9:43 And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two
hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire.
Mar 9:44
Mar 9:45 And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be
thrown into hell.
Mar 9:46
Mar 9:47 And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one
eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell,
Mar 9:48 'where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.'
Mar 9:49 For everyone will be salted with fire.
Mar 9:50 Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, how will you make it salty again? Have salt in
yourselves, and be at peace with one another."
Mar 10:1 And he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan, and crowds gathered to him
again. And again, as was his custom, he taught them.
Mar 10:2 And Pharisees came up and in order to test him asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"
Mar 10:3 He answered them, "What did Moses command you?"
Mar 10:4 They said, "Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away."
Mar 10:5 And Jesus said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.
Mar 10:6 But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.'
Mar 10:7 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife,
Mar 10:8 and they shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two but one flesh.
Mar 10:9 What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate."
Mar 10:10 And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter.
Mar 10:11 And he said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her,
Mar 10:12 and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery."
Mar 10:13 And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them.
Mar 10:14 But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, "Let the children come to me; do not
hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.
Mar 10:15 Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it."
Mar 10:16 And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.
Mar 10:17 And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, "Good
Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
Mar 10:18 And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.
Mar 10:19 You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear
false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.'"
Mar 10:20 And he said to him, "Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth."
Mar 10:21 And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, "You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have
and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
Mar 10:22 Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
Mar 10:23 And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How difficult it will be for those who have wealth
to enter the kingdom of God!"
Mar 10:24 And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, "Children, how difficult it
is to enter the kingdom of God!
Mar 10:25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom
of God."
Mar 10:26 And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, "Then who can be saved?"
Mar 10:27 Jesus looked at them and said, "With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are
possible with God."
Mar 10:28 Peter began to say to him, "See, we have left everything and followed you."
Mar 10:29 Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or
father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel,
Mar 10:30 who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and
children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life.Mar 10:31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first."
Mar 10:32 And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. And they
were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was
to happen to him,
Mar 10:33 saying, "See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief
priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles.
Mar 10:34 And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise."
Mar 10:35 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, "Teacher, we want you
to do for us whatever we ask of you."
Mar 10:36 And he said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
Mar 10:37 And they said to him, "Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory."
Mar 10:38 Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink,
or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?"
Mar 10:39 And they said to him, "We are able." And Jesus said to them, "The cup that I drink you will drink, and
with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized,
Mar 10:40 but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been
prepared."
Mar 10:41 And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John.
Mar 10:42 And Jesus called them to him and said to them, "You know that those who are considered rulers of
the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
Mar 10:43 But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant,
Mar 10:44 and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all.
Mar 10:45 For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for
many."
Mar 10:46 And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd,
Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside.
Mar 10:47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, "Jesus, Son of David,
have mercy on me!"
Mar 10:48 And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, "Son of David, have
mercy on me!"
Mar 10:49 And Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." And they called the blind man, saying to him, "Take heart.
Get up; he is calling you."
Mar 10:50 And throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus.
Mar 10:51 And Jesus said to him, "What do you want me to do for you?" And the blind man said to him, "Rabbi,
let me recover my sight."
Mar 10:52 And Jesus said to him, "Go your way; your faith has made you well." And immediately he recovered
his sight and followed him on the way.
Mar 11:1 Now when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus
sent two of his disciples
Mar 11:2 and said to them, "Go into the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt
tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it.
Mar 11:3 If anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord has need of it and will send it back
here immediately.'"
Mar 11:4 And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it.
Mar 11:5 And some of those standing there said to them, "What are you doing, untying the colt?"
Mar 11:6 And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go.
Mar 11:7 And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it.
Mar 11:8 And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from
the fields.
Mar 11:9 And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who
comes in the name of the Lord!
Mar 11:10 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!"
Mar 11:11 And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. And when he had looked around at everything,
as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
Mar 11:12 On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry.
Mar 11:13 And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he
came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
Mar 11:14 And he said to it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard it.
Mar 11:15 And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold andthose who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those
who sold pigeons.
Mar 11:16 And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple.
Mar 11:17 And he was teaching them and saying to them, "Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of
prayer for all the nations'? But you have made it a den of robbers."
Mar 11:18 And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared
him, because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching.
Mar 11:19 And when evening came they went out of the city.
Mar 11:20 As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots.
Mar 11:21 And Peter remembered and said to him, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered."
Mar 11:22 And Jesus answered them, "Have faith in God.
Mar 11:23 Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' and does
not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.
Mar 11:24 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.
Mar 11:25 And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father
also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."
Mar 11:26
Mar 11:27 And they came again to Jeru salem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the
scribes and the elders came to him,
Mar 11:28 and they said to him, "By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to
do them?"
Mar 11:29 Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do
these things.
Mar 11:30 Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man? Answer me."
Mar 11:31 And they discussed it with one another, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did
you not believe him?'
Mar 11:32 But shall we say, 'From man'?"- they were afraid of the people, for they all held that John really was a
prophet.
Mar 11:33 So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what
authority I do these things."
Mar 12:1 And he began to speak to them in parables. "A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and
dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower, and leased it to tenants and went into another country.
Mar 12:2 When the season came, he sent a servant to the tenants to get from them some of the fruit of the
vineyard.
Mar 12:3 And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
Mar 12:4 Again he sent to them another servant, and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully.
Mar 12:5 And he sent another, and him they killed. And so with many others: some they beat, and some they
killed.
Mar 12:6 He had still one other, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
Mar 12:7 But those tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will
be ours.'
Mar 12:8 And they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.
Mar 12:9 What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to
others.
Mar 12:10 Have you not read this Scripture: "' The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;
Mar 12:11 this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
Mar 12:12 And they were seeking to arrest him but feared the people, for they perceived that he had told the
parable against them. So they left him and went away.
Mar 12:13 And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians, to trap him in his talk.
Mar 12:14 And they came and said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone's
opinion. For you are not swayed by appearances, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Cae
sar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?"
Mar 12:15 But, knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, "Why put me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let
me look at it."
Mar 12:16 And they brought one. And he said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" They said to
him, "Caesar's."
Mar 12:17 Jesus said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are
God's." And they marveled at him.
Mar 12:18 And Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection. And they asked him a question,saying,
Mar 12:19 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the
man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
Mar 12:20 There were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no offspring.
Mar 12:21 And the second took her, and died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise.
Mar 12:22 And the seven left no offspring. Last of all the woman also died.
Mar 12:23 In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife."
Mar 12:24 Jesus said to them, "Is this not the reason you are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures
nor the power of God?
Mar 12:25 For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in
heaven.
Mar 12:26 And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the
bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?
Mar 12:27 He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You are quite wrong."
Mar 12:28 And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he
answered them well, asked him, "Which commandment is the most important of all?"
Mar 12:29 Jesus answered, "The most important is, 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
Mar 12:30 And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
and with all your strength.'
Mar 12:31 The second is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment
greater than these."
Mar 12:32 And the scribe said to him, "You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that he is one, and there is
no other besides him.
Mar 12:33 And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love
one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
Mar 12:34 And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of
God." And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Mar 12:35 And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, "How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of
David?
Mar 12:36 David himself, in the Holy Spirit, declared, "' The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I put
your enemies under your feet.'
Mar 12:37 David himself calls him Lord. So how is he his son?" And the great throng heard him gladly.
Mar 12:38 And in his teaching he said, "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and like
greetings in the marketplaces
Mar 12:39 and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,
Mar 12:40 who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater
condemnation."
Mar 12:41 And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box.
Many rich people put in large sums.
Mar 12:42 And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny.
Mar 12:43 And he called his disciples to him and said to them, "Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in
more than all those who are contributing to the offering box.
Mar 12:44 For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she
had, all she had to live on."
Mar 13:1 And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher, what wonderful
stones and what wonderful buildings!"
Mar 13:2 And Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon
another that will not be thrown down."
Mar 13:3 And as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew
asked him privately,
Mar 13:4 "Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be
accomplished?"
Mar 13:5 And Jesus began to say to them, "See that no one leads you astray.
Mar 13:6 Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and they will lead many astray.
Mar 13:7 And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. This must take place, but the end
is not yet.
Mar 13:8 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various
places; there will be famines. These are but the beginning of the birth pains.
Mar 13:9 "But be on your guard. For they will deliver you over to councils, and you will be beaten insynagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them.
Mar 13:10 And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations.
Mar 13:11 And when they bring you to trial and deliver you over, do not be anxious beforehand what you are to
say, but say whatever is given you in that hour, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.
Mar 13:12 And brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against
parents and have them put to death.
Mar 13:13 And you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
Mar 13:14 "But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not to be ( let the reader
understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
Mar 13:15 Let the one who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter his house, to take anything out,
Mar 13:16 and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.
Mar 13:17 And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days!
Mar 13:18 Pray that it may not happen in winter.
Mar 13:19 For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the beginning of the creation that
God created until now, and never will be.
Mar 13:20 And if the Lord had not cut short the days, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the
elect, whom he chose, he shortened the days.
Mar 13:21 And then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.
Mar 13:22 False christs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible,
the elect.
Mar 13:23 But be on guard; I have told you all things beforehand.
Mar 13:24 "But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,
Mar 13:25 and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.
Mar 13:26 And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
Mar 13:27 And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the
earth to the ends of heaven.
Mar 13:28 "From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you
know that summer is near.
Mar 13:29 So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates.
Mar 13:30 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
Mar 13:31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
Mar 13:32 "But concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but
only the Father.
Mar 13:33 Be on guard, keep awake. For you do not know when the time will come.
Mar 13:34 It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge, each with
his work, and commands the doorkeeper to stay awake.
Mar 13:35 Therefore stay awake- for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening,
or at midnight, or when the cock crows, or in the morningMar 13:36 lest he come suddenly and find you asleep.
Mar 13:37 And what I say to you I say to all: Stay awake."
Mar 14:1 It was now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests
and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth and kill him,
Mar 14:2 for they said, "Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar from the people."
Mar 14:3 And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, a woman
came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his
head.
Mar 14:4 There were some who said to themselves indignantly, "Why was the ointment wasted like that?
Mar 14:5 For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor."
And they scolded her.
Mar 14:6 But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
Mar 14:7 For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you
will not always have me.
Mar 14:8 She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial.
Mar 14:9 And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will
be told in memory of her."
Mar 14:10 Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to
them.
Mar 14:11 And when they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. And he sought an
opportunity to betray him.Mar 14:12 And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said
to him, "Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
Mar 14:13 And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water
will meet you. Follow him,
Mar 14:14 and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says, Where is my guest
room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'
Mar 14:15 And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us."
Mar 14:16 And the disciples set out and went to the city and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared
the Passover.
Mar 14:17 And when it was evening, he came with the twelve.
Mar 14:18 And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray
me, one who is eating with me."
Mar 14:19 They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, "Is it I?"
Mar 14:20 He said to them, "It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me.
Mar 14:21 For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is
betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born."
Mar 14:22 And as they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said,
"Take; this is my body."
Mar 14:23 And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it.
Mar 14:24 And he said to them, "This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.
Mar 14:25 Truly, I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the
kingdom of God."
Mar 14:26 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Mar 14:27 And Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the
sheep will be scattered.'
Mar 14:28 But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee."
Mar 14:29 Peter said to him, "Even though they all fall away, I will not."
Mar 14:30 And Jesus said to him, "Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny
me three times."
Mar 14:31 But he said emphatically, "If I must die with you, I will not deny you." And they all said the same.
Mar 14:32 And they went to a place called Gethsemane. And he said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."
Mar 14:33 And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled.
Mar 14:34 And he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch."
Mar 14:35 And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might
pass from him.
Mar 14:36 And he said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I
will, but what you will."
Mar 14:37 And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not
watch one hour?
Mar 14:38 Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak."
Mar 14:39 And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.
Mar 14:40 And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know
what to answer him.
Mar 14:41 And he came the third time and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is
enough; the hour has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Mar 14:42 Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand."
Mar 14:43 And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd
with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
Mar 14:44 Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I will kiss is the man. Seize him and lead
him away under guard."
Mar 14:45 And when he came, he went up to him at once and said, "Rabbi!" And he kissed him.
Mar 14:46 And they laid hands on him and seized him.
Mar 14:47 But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his
ear.
Mar 14:48 And Jesus said to them, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture
me?
Mar 14:49 Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the Scriptures
be fulfilled."Mar 14:50 And they all left him and fled.
Mar 14:51 And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body. And they seized him,
Mar 14:52 but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.
Mar 14:53 And they led Jesus to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came
together.
Mar 14:54 And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was
sitting with the guards and warming himself at the fire.
Mar 14:55 Now the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to
death, but they found none.
Mar 14:56 For many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree.
Mar 14:57 And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,
Mar 14:58 "We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build
another, not made with hands.'"
Mar 14:59 Yet even about this their testimony did not agree.
Mar 14:60 And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer to make? What is it
that these men testify against you?"
Mar 14:61 But he remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ,
the Son of the Blessed?"
Mar 14:62 And Jesus said, "I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and
coming with the clouds of heaven."
Mar 14:63 And the high priest tore his garments and said, "What further witnesses do we need?
Mar 14:64 You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?" And they all condemned him as deserving
death.
Mar 14:65 And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him, saying to him, "Prophesy!"
And the guards received him with blows.
Mar 14:66 And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came,
Mar 14:67 and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, "You also were with the Nazarene,
Jesus."
Mar 14:68 But he denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you mean." And he went out into the
gateway and the rooster crowed.
Mar 14:69 And the servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, "This man is one of them."
Mar 14:70 But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, "Cer tainly you are
one of them, for you are a Galilean."
Mar 14:71 But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not know this man of whom you
speak."
Mar 14:72 And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to
him, "Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times." And he broke down and wept.
Mar 15:1 And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and
the whole Council. And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate.
Mar 15:2 And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he answered him, "You have said so."
Mar 15:3 And the chief priests accused him of many things.
Mar 15:4 And Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring
against you."
Mar 15:5 But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.
Mar 15:6 Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked.
Mar 15:7 And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man
called Barabbas.
Mar 15:8 And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them.
Mar 15:9 And he answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"
Mar 15:10 For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up.
Mar 15:11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead.
Mar 15:12 And Pilate again said to them, "Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?"
Mar 15:13 And they cried out again, "Crucify him."
Mar 15:14 And Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him."
Mar 15:15 So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, he
delivered him to be crucified.
Mar 15:16 And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters), and they
called together the whole battalion.
Mar 15:17 And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him.Mar 15:18 And they began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
Mar 15:19 And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him.
Mar 15:20 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on
him. And they led him out to crucify him.
Mar 15:21 And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of
Alex ander and Rufus, to carry his cross.
Mar 15:22 And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull).
Mar 15:23 And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
Mar 15:24 And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what
each should take.
Mar 15:25 And it was the third hour when they crucified him.
Mar 15:26 And the inscription of the charge against him read, "The King of the Jews."
Mar 15:27 And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.
Mar 15:28
Mar 15:29 And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, "Aha! You who would
destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
Mar 15:30 save yourself, and come down from the cross!"
Mar 15:31 So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, "He saved others; he
cannot save himself.
Mar 15:32 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe."
Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.
Mar 15:33 And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
Mar 15:34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My
God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
Mar 15:35 And some of the bystanders hearing it said, "Behold, he is calling Elijah."
Mar 15:36 And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink,
saying, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down."
Mar 15:37 And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last.
Mar 15:38 And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.
Mar 15:39 And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said,
"Truly this man was the Son of God!"
Mar 15:40 There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary
the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.
Mar 15:41 When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him, and there were also many other
women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
Mar 15:42 And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the
Sabbath,
Mar 15:43 Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the Council, who was also himself looking for the
kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Mar 15:44 Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. And summoning the centurion, he
asked him whether he was already dead.
Mar 15:45 And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph.
Mar 15:46 And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid
him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
Mar 15:47 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
Mar 16:1 , When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought
spices, so that they might go and anoint him.
Mar 16:2 And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.
Mar 16:3 And they were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the
tomb?"
Mar 16:4 And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back- it was very large.
Mar 16:5 And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and
they were alarmed.
Mar 16:6 And he said to them, "Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has
risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him.
Mar 16:7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just
as he told you."
Mar 16:8 And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they
said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid. [SOME OF THE EARLIEST MANUSCRIPTS DO NOT INCLUDE16:9-20.]
Mar 16:9 [[Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from
whom he had cast out seven demons.
Mar 16:10 She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
Mar 16:11 But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.
Mar 16:12 After these things he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.
Mar 16:13 And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.
Mar 16:14 Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at table, and he rebuked
them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had
risen.
Mar 16:15 And he said to them, "Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation.
Mar 16:16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
Mar 16:17 And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will
speak in new tongues;
Mar 16:18 they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them;
they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover."
Mar 16:19 So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the
right hand of God.
Mar 16:20 And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the
message by accompanying signs.]]
